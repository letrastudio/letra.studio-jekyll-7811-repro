There are many websites, but this one is mine.

I don't run analytics or visitor tracking of any kind. I do my best to offer semantic HTML that is accessible to everyone (please [let me know](mailto:hello@letra.studio) if it's not). CSS is optional, but recommended; the stylesheet is based on my own [Cobalt](https://github.com/letrastudio/cobalt) boilerplate. Javascript is very optional. Timestamps are all in [Lisbon time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/portugal/lisbon).

Text is typeset in [Input Sans Narrow](https://djr.com/input/) by David Jonathan Ross. David is super nice and I thank him for his patience and encouragement as I messed around with the site's typography and asked him for feedback. The Letra Studio logotype is set in [Scandia Medium](https://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/scandia/) from Process Type Foundry.

This is a static site, built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and a few plugins: [jekyll-paginate-v2](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2), [jekyll-archives](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives), and [jekyll-sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap). Backend code is written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and relies heavily on [Express](https://expressjs.com). Everything is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com), which I cannot recommend enough. I use [Coda](https://panic.com/coda/) for writing code, [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for writing prose, [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) for most design work, [Soulver](https://soulver.app) for math, and [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) to make Git enjoyable.

This site follows the principles of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org), because I like owning my content and my place on the web. Posts are published with [Micropub](https://micropub.net), using `rel-me` authentication by way of [indieauth.com](https://indieauth.com). Syndication feeds are offered in both [Atom](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287) and [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org) formats. In the future I plan to implement [microformats](http://microformats.org) and [Webmention](https://webmention.net) — stay tuned!

You can find me and other sites like mine on [personalsit.es](https://personalsit.es).
